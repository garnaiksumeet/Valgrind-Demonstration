# Valgrind-Demonstration

This is a project just for the purpose of demonstration of using valgrind to perform memory and time profiling.

The scripts require the programs KCachegrind and Massif-visualizer to be installed. In case you do not want to install these programs, please edit the file bash scripts to run callgrind_annotate and ms_print respectively.
